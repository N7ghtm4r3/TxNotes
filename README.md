        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

- Add the dependencies

```gradle
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.N7ghtm4r3:TxNotes:1.0.4'
	//to make TxNotes works correctly you must implement also the main library:
	implementation 'com.github.N7ghtm4r3:TraderBot:1.1.1'
}
```

## ðŸ›  Skills

- Java

## Platforms available

- **Binance**
- **Coinbase**

The other platforms will be gradually released

## Usage/Examples

**Note:** your exchange platform api keys **will not be** stored anywhere in our system, so is your responsibility
manage them.

### Native use

Fetchers work without Tecknobit's Android interface

#### Interface

You have to create your code flow to use fetcher

```java
//Platform means Binance or Coinbase actually
PlatformFetcher fetcher = new PlatformPlatformFetcher(/*your keys and constructor params*/);
//Operation example
fetcher.fetchTxNotesList();
```

#### Autonomous

Fetchers fetch autonomously all the newest transactions

```java
//Platform means Binance or Coinbase actually
PlatformAutoFetcher fetcher = new PlatformAutoFetcher(/*your keys and constructor params*/);
//Start autonomous trader flow 
fetcher.start();
```

### Android use

Fetchers work with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tecknobit.txnotes">Tecknobit's Android
interface </a><br>
All data will be stored and restored automatically, **will be not saved** your exchange platform api keys. <br>
**Note:** is recommended to use different password from exchange's account for Tecknobit's account for a major security.

#### Auth operations

- #### Registration
  To register a new fetcher you have to use Credentials object to init your Tecknobit's account credentials.
  In first attempt will throw a SaveData exception, so you can save credentials generated.

```java
//In registration, you have to init TxNotesCredentials object with your email and password for Tecknobit's account.

TxNotesCredentials credentials=new TxNotesCredentials("yourEmail@email.com","yourPassword");

//Program will automatically stop and will give to you auth credentials in this format:

/*     
    {
      "secret_key": "valueOfSecretKey",
      "password": "yourPasswordInserted",
      "email": "yourEmailInserted@email.com",
      "iv_spec": "valueOfIvSpec",
      "auth_token": "valueOfAuthToken",
      "token": "valueOfToken"
    }
*/

//Note you must save these credentials where you retain safe because them are needed in auth operations.
```

- #### Login
  In login operation you have to use TxNotesCredentials object to init your Tecknobit's account credentials.

```java
//In login operation you have to init TxNotesCredentials object with your credentials given from Registration

TxNotesCredentials credentials=new TxNotesCredentials("valueOfAuthToken",
        "yourEmail@email.com",
        "yourPassword",
        "valueOfIvSpec",
        "valueOfSecretKey"
        );

//Then you have to insert credentials object in Android's trader constructor and trader will start with your Tecknobit's account.

AndroidPlatformFetcher fetcher = new AndroidPlatformFetcher(/*your keys and constructor params*/,credentials);

```

#### Run operations

It is very simple to start the chosen fetcher in order to start its workflow autonomously, this means that all
operations will be performed by itself, following the procedure:

```java
//Platform means Binance or Coinbase actually
AndroidPlatformFetcher fetcher = new AndroidPlatformFetcher(/*your keys and constructor params*/,credentials);
//Operation example
fetcher.startWorkflow();
```
